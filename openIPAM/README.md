# MACHINE SETUP

## Prerequisites
- python3.12 
- pip3
- libldap2-dev
- libsasl2-dev
- postgresql


## Setup
To install dependencies, run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal from the root directory. You may need to create a virtual environment for whichever version of python you're using (>3.12). If so, run `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`, then install the dependencies in your activated virtual environment. All python commands need to be run in this environment for the server to work.

Now we need to set up the configuration for the server. Run `cp openIPAM/openipam_config.example openIPAM/openipam_config`. Adjust the settings for `auth`, `backend`, and `dhcp` python files. Make sure that `server_listen` and `server_subnet` are both correct in the `dhcp` file (`server_subnet` is used for the test file, not the actual code, so it isn't essential unless you run the test).

In order to be able to bind to port 67, we need to grant the program access. There are three methods to do this:
- Run the program as sudo
- grant capabilities via `setcap`
- Using `authbind`

We'll show how to run it using Authbind, though the other methods should work:
```bash
sudo apt install authbind
sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/67
sudo chmod 777 /etc/authbind/byport/67
# Run the command via authbind (allows python to access port 67)
authbind --deep python3 openIPAM/openipam_dhcpd.py
```

The DHCP Server should now be up and running correctly.
